# Stocky

Stocky is a hypothetical platform that rewards users with shares of Indian stocks (like Reliance, TCS, Infosys) for actions such as onboarding, referrals, or trading milestones. Users receive full stock units, while Stocky handles purchases from NSE/BSE, including brokerage, taxes, and regulatory fees, which are tracked internally.

The system also updates the INR valuation of user holdings hourly via a hypothetical price service.
